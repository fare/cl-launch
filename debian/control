Description: uniform frontend to running Common Lisp code from the shell
 CL-Launch will allow you to invoke Common Lisp source code from the shell
 command line, from a shell script or as a Common Lisp script. It will also
 allow you to turn your Common Lisp source programs into standalone
 executables or executable shell scripts (optionally using a dumped image),
 depending on the features available in your underlying implementation.
 .
 CL-Launch will automatically detect a supported Common Lisp implementation
 and use adequate invocation options. It can also be configured to fit exactly
 the programmer's desires. Fully supported implementations are:
        Allegro, CLISP, ClozureCL, CMUCL, ECL, SBCL, SCL.
 Partially supported implementations are:
        LispWorks Professional, ABCL, GCL, XCL.
 Creating standalone executables is supported on:
        CLISP, ClozureCL, CMUCL, LispWorks, SBCL, SCL
 .
 CL-Launch also offers Common Lisp programs a simple uniform interface to
 invocation parameters (command-line arguments and environment variables).
 It relies on ASDF 3 for system construction. See the ASDF 3 manual for
 more information on how to configure source and object code location.
 CL-Launch may dump memory images for fast startup (at the expense of disk
 space). It can also be used as a quick way to evaluate and print simple Lisp
 forms or scripts from the command-line without invoking a full-fledged REPL,
 and to easily compare results between implementations.
